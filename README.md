## Challenges
- **UI/UX design** part was crucial, i took arround 2-3 days for making design ready in the Figma.
- Selection of **Phone OTP** Authentication. I selected this method as we all use our phone number daily, so why remember passwords and username, OTP auth is so easy for end users.
- **Data Modeling**, this part was very important and i acheived it in given timeline.
- **Play Store release**, i submitted app to play store, it's Live, [Download from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.splitty.android).
